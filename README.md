### Project Description
The goal of this project is to make a stepper motor motion firmware for RP2040-based microcontroller. This will include: 
- a user-friendly library for abstracting stepper motor control for major stepper motor drivers.
- Simple motion planning for synchronous multi-axis machines such as CNC or 3D Printer
- Compatibility with G-code

## Example usage
